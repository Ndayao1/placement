Make a master dataset with all the facilities from the 3 provinces
Clean up - Merge, pivot long as necessary, check for complete reports, select facilities of interest
Extract data from the other reports and merge with this - FP, Child health, Immunisation
Make groupings for the different procinces to express totals
Create summaries for the study hospitals vs respective provinces 
Look up trends across the years
Create visualisation marking the various intervention points - infrastructure, training
Create data frames for the different populations - maternal, child health, immunisation, FP
Create averages for respective columns (coverage columns)
When making visualisations, add a trendline for the total reports for the respective years
For relevant reports, create proportion summaries (% based on respective columns e.g, 3rd Pentavalent as a % of respective population
Remember to check the descrition/computation of each variable
Have the totals and proportions of the hospitals propped against the respective province totals
